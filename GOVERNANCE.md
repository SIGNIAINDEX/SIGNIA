# Governance

SIGNIA is maintained by the community.

## Maintainers

Maintainers:
- Review and merge PRs
- Cut releases
- Manage security disclosures
- Curate roadmap priorities

## Decision Making

We aim for rough consensus:
- Small changes: maintainer approval
- Breaking changes: design discussion + maintainer approval
- Security: private coordination per `SECURITY.md`
