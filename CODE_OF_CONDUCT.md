# Code of Conduct

This project follows the **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct** (v2.1), adapted for the SIGNIA community.

## 1. Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## 3. Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to private communications made in the context of community spaces when such communications impact the safety and well-being of community members.

## 5. Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.

### Reporting

**Preferred:** GitHub Security Advisories (for sensitive reports) or a private email.

- GitHub: Use the "Report a vulnerability" or contact maintainers through repository settings if enabled.
- Email: `security@signia.example` (replace this placeholder before publishing if you will use email).

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information (so we can follow up)
- Names of any individuals involved (real names are not required)
- Description of what happened and when/where it occurred
- Supporting logs, links, screenshots, or context (if available)
- Whether you believe the incident is ongoing
- Any safety concerns for you or others

We will respect your privacy and handle reports with discretion.

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of reports within **72 hours** and will provide updates as the report is triaged. Complex situations may take longer, but we will communicate expected next steps.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled confidentially to the extent possible. Sharing information beyond those involved in resolution may be necessary to ensure safety and enforce this Code of Conduct.

## 6. Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 6.1 Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 6.2 Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time.

### 6.3 Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from community interaction for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved during this period.

### 6.4 Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including harassment of individuals, or aggression or hostility toward community members.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any community interaction.

## 7. Appeal Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused or sanctioned, you may request an appeal. Appeals should be submitted via the same reporting channels. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved in the initial decision when possible.

Appeals are intended to correct errors or procedural mistakes. They are not intended to relitigate disputes or override safety decisions.

## 8. Attribution
